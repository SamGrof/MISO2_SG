Welcome to the documentation of the MISO2 model
================================================

This repository contains the code for the MISO2 model, a ...

This repository is not under active development, but maintained

It is therefore not meant as a ready-to-use MFA model, but serves to make the creation of the MatStocks database reproducible.

The input data for two countries, United States of America and United Kingdom, is provided.

The repository contains working examples of how to process this input data, run the model, and how to access the results.

MISO2 wraps functionality from the `ODYM package <https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM>`_ and contains a
slightly modified version of the ODYM v1 release. Changes relate to parsing and the creation of survival functions.
