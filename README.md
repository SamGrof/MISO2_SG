# Welcome to the documentation of the MISO2 model

The MISO2 model (Material Inputs, Stocks, and Outputs) is a dynamic, inflow-driven model that covers 14 supply chain processes from raw material extraction to waste management. It provides a global, country-level application and covers 23 raw materials and 20 stock-building materials across 177 countries from 1820 to 2016.

**Key Features**:

- Economy-wide material flow analysis (ew-MFA)
- Dynamic modeling of material stocks and flows
- Comprehensive coverage of raw materials, stock-building materials, and end-uses
- Global country-level application from 1820 to 2016

The documentation #LINK provides an overview of the software, guides on setup and usage, as well as detailed API references.
We give working examples of how to process this input data, run the model, and access the results.
Input data for two countries, United States of America and United Kingdom, is provided to test the model.

MISO2 wraps functionality from the [ODYM package](https://github.com/IndEcol/ODYM) and
contains a slightly modified version of the ODYM v1 release adapted to our needs.
